# ExcelHeaderChecker

Information: This python script automates a portion of the data reviewing process as a data analyst intern at Integra Technologies. There are sample excel files and production excel files. Sample files have data that has been previously approved by the engineer whereas production files have data that is newly produced. This script is used to compare 6 rows of header information between sample files and production files. These 6 rows consists of test names, test numbers, test notes, units, max limits, min limits. Sometimes there are a few columns of headers to compare which can be done by hand, sometimes there are a few hundred, and sometimes there are a few thousand. Automating this process allows the user to easily see consistencies or differences such as limits due to a revision.
